My final year Honour's project created for the Museum of Discovery, made in 2021.
 We created a digital twin of an active exhibition in Babylon.js, an online 3D game engine.

 Custom Made is an exhibition at the UniSA Museum of Discovery (MOD.) made by UniSA students to demonstrate the benefits of Industry 4.0, Custom on-demand product design, and manufacture by a robotic arm. Our project is a Digital Twin of this exhibit, a virtual representation of a physical system that runs in parallel. It can be used to visualise the state of the physical system and to run simulations, test new functionality, and more. Our Twin runs in a 3D web app accessible via mobile, tablet and PC. It allows users to configure a vehicle, watch the robot arm build it according to their specifications, and drive the vehicle around the exciting, interactive test track - an experience matching the functionality of the real-life exhibit.
